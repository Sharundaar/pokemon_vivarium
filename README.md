			Pokemon Vivarium

What is it ?
-----------
It is a program I decided to make as a personal project. Pokemons pop on the map, and if they encounters another pokemon, they start to fight. The looser disappears and the winner gains xp and continues to move.
All of the pokemon experience concept is respected. I chose to implements only the pokemons of the first generation (so the attack list corresponds also to the first generation).
I wrote this program in C++ with vim using the SFML library (version 2.1 : http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/index-fr.php). Concerning the xml, I used the library rapidxml for parsing. (http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/). It is a very effective library and easy to manipulate. Here is where I learned how to use rapidxml : https://gist.github.com/JSchaenzle/2726944.

The Latest Version
------------------
The latest version is unfinished. Bugs still exist and all the concepts I first intended to implement in my program have not yet been all done. See the TODO file for more information.

Commands
--------
There are severall key input you can do on the screen :
-> The arrows can move the camera.
-> The SPACE key stops/continues the pop of pokemons.
-> The PAGE/PAGEDOWN increases/decreases the scale ratio of the map.
-> the +/- on the numeric pad keys increases/decreases the speed of the scene.
-> 8/2 keys on the numeric pad moves up/down the list of pokemons in the statFrame.
-> ENTER key quits the game.

Installation
------------
I have not yet created a way to install the program directly on any software. For the moment; it is just a portable version of the vivarium (works only on Linux).

Execute the program
------------------
To execute the program, tou just need to execute the main.out in the directory /project_vivarium/project_vivarium/.
